@ARTICLE{Minchin1987,
  title     = "Simulation of Multidimensional Community Patterns: Towards a
               Comprehensive Model",
  author    = "Minchin, Peter R",
  abstract  = "Simulated data, derived from descriptive models of community
               variation along ecological gradients, are useful for the
               evaluation of ordination techniques and other numerical methods
               for the analysis of community data. Existing approaches to the
               simulation of community patterns are based on restrictive
               assumptions, although there is evidence supporting several
               alternative models. Simulation studies should aim to assess the
               robustness of analytical techniques to variations in model
               properties. This paper describes a modelling procedure which
               encompasses most current concepts and hypotheses about the
               properties of community patterns. The procedure has been used to
               assess the comparative robustness of several ordination
               techniques and to examine the effectiveness of alternative
               coefficients of compositional dissimilarity. COMPAS, a FORTRAN
               77 computer program which implements the modelling procedure, is
               available on application to the author.",
