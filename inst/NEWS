coenocliner 0.2-0
=================

* The object returned by `coenocline()` now has S3 class `"coenocline"`
  and inherits from the `"matrix"` class.

* A `print()` method has been added for `coenocline()` which displays
  some summary information and the first `n` lines of the simulated
  counts. This is rudimentary; I'd like to have something like the
  way **dplyr** prints data frames implemented for the next release.

* A `stack()` method for `coenocline()` was added. This makes it much
  easier to reshape the simulated count data into a format suitable for
  use with **ggplot** or **lattice** graphics, or R's modelling
  functions.

Bug fixes
---------

* Jari Oksanen noticed an annoying but important bug in the 2D Beta
  response function; the `gamma` parameter for the second gradient
  was being ignored, and the value of `gamma` for the first gradient
  was used instead.

coenocliner 0.1-0
=================

* An R package for coenocline simulation; generating simulated species
  abundance or occurence data along one or two gradients

* First public release of coenocliner on CRAN

* Species response can be parameterised using either the classic
  Gaussian response model or the generalise beta response model

* Random count or occurence data can be simulated from species
  responses using random draws from a Poisson, Negative Binomial,
  Binomial, Beta-binomial, ZIP, ZINB, or Bernoulli distribution with
  the parameterised response curve taken as the mean or expectation of
  the distribution to draw from

* The main user-facing function is `coenocline()`. See `?coenocliner`
  and `?coenocline` for further details and examples of usage

* A basic overview and introductory tutorial for coenocliner is available.
