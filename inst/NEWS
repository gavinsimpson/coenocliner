coenocliner 0.1-0
=================

* An R package for coenocline simulation; generating simulated species
  abundance or occurence data along one or two gradients

* First public release of coenocliner on CRAN

* Species response can be parameterised using either the classic
  Gaussian response model or the generalise beta response model

* Random count or occurence data can be simulated from species responses
  using random draws from a Poisson, Negative Binomial, or Bernoulli
  distribution with the parameterised response curve taken as the mean
  or expectation of the the distribution to draw from

* The main user-facing function is `coenocline()`. See `?coenocliner`
  and `?coenocline` for further details and examples of usage
