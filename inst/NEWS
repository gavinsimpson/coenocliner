coenocliner 0.1-0
=================

* An R package for coenocline simulation; generating simulated species
  abundance or occurence data along one or two gradients

* First public release of coenocliner on CRAN

* Species response can be parameterised using either the classic
  Gaussian response model or the generalise beta response model

* Random count or occurence data can be simulated from species
  responses using random draws from a Poisson, Negative Binomial,
  Binomial, Beta-binomial, ZIP, ZINB, or Bernoulli distribution with
  the parameterised response curve taken as the mean or expectation of
  the distribution to draw from

* The main user-facing function is `coenocline()`. See `?coenocliner`
  and `?coenocline` for further details and examples of usage

* A basic overview and introductory tutorial for coenocliner is available.
  Run `browseVignettes("coenocliner")` in R to access the PDF, R code and
