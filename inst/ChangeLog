coencliner Change Log

Version 0.0-8

	* Binomial, BetaBinomial: New wrappers for random number
	generation for the Binomial and Beta-Binomial distributions.
	The Binomial distribution allows simulation of binomial counts
	from a probability of occurence and binomial denominator, m,
	the number of trials (number of individuals counted).

	The Beta-Binomial() allows is an extra-variance Binomial
	distribution and allows simulation of overdispersed binomial
	count data in a manner similar to that by which the Negative
	Binomial distribution can be used to generate overdispersed
	Poisson count data.

Version 0.0-7

	* Beta: now implemented for one or two gradients.

Version 0.0-6

	* Binomial(): this really should have been Bernoulli and now is.

Version 0.0-5

	* Old code: This version removed all the `simxDfoo()` functions
	and associated helpers (`betaResponse()`, `gaussianResponse()`,
	`biGaussianResponse()`, `expandGauss()`, `expandBeta()`) as
	these are now no longer needed given that we have `coenocline()`
	as a gneral interface to all these things.

Version 0.0-4

	* Gaussian() & Beta() modified to take lists of arguments, `px`
	and `py`, to simplify the naming of species parameters in these
	models.

	* coenocline() modified to supply arguments in the format now
	required by `Gaussian()` and `Beta()`.

Version 0.0-3

	* coenocline() a generic interface to coenocline simulation.

	* Beta(), Gaussian(); new response model functions for the
	classic Gaussian response model and the generalised Beta
	response model.

	* New wrappers for random deviate generation from Poisson,
	Binomial, and Negative binomial distributions.

	* expand() a new general version of the expand.grid()-like
	functionality where we repeat sets of parameters for each of
	n gradient locations.

Version 0.0-2

	* added simulators for occurrence not abundance
	Code provided by F. Rodriguez-Sanchez.

Version 0.0-1

	* intial alpha version
