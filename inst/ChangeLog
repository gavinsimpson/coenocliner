coencliner Change Log

Version 0.0-5

	* Old code: This version removed all the `simxDfoo()` functions
	and associated helpers (`betaResponse()`, `gaussianResponse()`,
	`biGaussianResponse()`, `expandGauss()`, `expandBeta()`) as
	these are now no longer needed given that we have `coenocline()`
	as a gneral interface to all these things.

Version 0.0-4

	* Gaussian() & Beta() modified to take lists of arguments, `px`
	and `py`, to simplify the naming of species parameters in these
	models.

	* coenocline() modified to supply arguments in the format now
	required by `Gaussian()` and `Beta()`.

Version 0.0-3

	* coenocline() a generic interface to coenocline simulation.

	* Beta(), Gaussian(); new response model functions for the
	classic Gaussian response model and the generalised Beta
	response model.

	* New wrappers for random deviate generation from Poisson,
	Binomial, and Negative binomial distributions.

	* expand() a new general version of the expand.grid()-like
	functionality where we repeat sets of parameters for each of
	n gradient locations.

Version 0.0-2

	* added simulators for occurrence not abundance
	Code provided by F. Rodriguez-Sanchez.

Version 0.0-1

	* intial alpha version
